This is a list of files for a blog application that I have completed for my web communication project at JensenYh. The first function is that it "fetches" blog post from the API: : 
https://blog-api-assignment.up.railway.app/posts and displays blog posts made by my classmates and myself (Mine is a post on Mary Earps who is a goal keeper for the women's national team in England).

**Note to reader: The GitRespitory is a bit chaotic due to not getting the "hang" of GitHub just yet. I had to start a new one well into my project because of having technical problems**

**Other funcationaly: An ability to see more of a specific post when "read more" is clicked** (GET: https://blog-api-assignment.up.railway.app/posts/)

**A link to an admin index** (in a seperate folder titled admin where you see posts title, names, and tags

**The ability to create a post by using a seperate admin section that after this function is used it returns you back to the admin index** ( https://blog-api-assignment.up.railway.app/posts)

**The ability to delete a specific post from the admin panel with an alert asking the user if they "really want to delete" a apecific blog entry and then returns the user to the admin panel**
(https://blog-api-assignment.up.railway.app/posts/)

**The ability to update posts by clicking on the update button. After update then returns to the admin panel** (https://blog-api-assignment.up.railway.app/posts/)

**This site is designed is stylized by bootstrap du to it's ability to have a more cohesive and better quality than using CSS (trust me I tried)**
